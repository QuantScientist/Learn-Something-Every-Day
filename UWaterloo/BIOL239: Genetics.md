# Genetics
- mendelian inheritance, how it relates to genotype, phenotype and alleles 
- differences of gene structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- Drosophal
- when breeding, to figure out genotypes, we want to take pure bred Ps, cross to form F<sub>1</sub>, and cross F<sub>1</sub> to get F<sub>2</sub>, then inspect ratio to determine whether the trait is complete dominance (1:3), codominance (1:2:1), incomplete dominance (1:2:1), two genes interacting (9:3:3:1), complementary genes (9:7)

#### Introduction
Mendelian genetics, pedigree analysis is applied for humans
- **phenotype** is something we can see & observe (trait); end result rather than genetic representation
- **genotype**: genetic make up; description of the genetic information (what are the alleles that make it up)
- **progeny**: descendants
- Mendel's experiments with garden peas: **cross-fertilization/cross-pollination**
- anthers that contain pollen and cross-fertilize using pollen between purple and white (different phenotype) pea flowers
  - cross fertilizing weren't clones!
- **monohybrid crosses** come from pure breeds: ex. pure yellow pea and pure green pea
- breeding pures, they're called F<sub>1</sub> progeny, or first filial (monohybrids since only one trait has evolved)
- Discrete units of inheritance are **alleles** of genes, and are instances of a single gene
  - *hair colour* is the gene (object), black and brown are alleles (instances)
- diploid organisms means they only ever have two alleles for a given gene as a part of their DNA (more than one allele may exist among a population though)
- by convention, *genes* are written in italics
- **homozygous** means both alleles are the same for a gene vs. **heterozygous**
- **polymorphic** 
- **gametes** are the reproductive cells
- **Mendel's law of segregation**: two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation and unite at random during fertilization
- Peas are wrinkled based on whether they are soluble or not
  - starch active branching enzyme makes the starch insoluble, acting catalytically 
- **Dihybrid crosses** with respect to two genes have different alleles for both genes; come from two pure bred homozygous dominant and recessive parents respectively
- **Mendel's Law of Independent assortment**: during gamete formation, different pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other
- by summing genotypic ratios, we get the phenotypic ratios 1:2:1 and 9:3:3:1 for one and two genes respectively
- a **test cross** is used to find a genotype from a phenotype

### Mendelian
Genes can have incomplete dominance or codominanance, resulting in new phenotype ratios
- some genes might have multiple possible alleles, in which case you can determine a **dominance series** by crossing every combination of homozygotes
- **complementation** between two genes is when the phenotype changes if either of two genes has homozygous recessive (mutations in the same gene result in the same phenotypic offspring, while mutations in different genes results in the new phenotype in F1)
- **epistatic** is control over another gene
  - we see three phenotypes: one for both dominant, and two for at least one recessive phenotype (where only one shows through for both recessive) 
  - that is when F2 is homozygous recessive for the epistatic gene, then we see a new phenotype. The ratio is 9:3:4 for **recessive epistasis**
