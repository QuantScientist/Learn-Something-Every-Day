# Genetics
- mendelian inheritance, how it relates to genotype, phenotype and alleles 
- differences of gene structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- Drosophal

#### Introduction
Mendelian genetics, pedigree analysis is applied for humans
- **phenotype** is something we can see & observe (trait); end result rather than genetic representation
- **genotype**: genetic make up; description of the genetic information
- Mendel's experiments with garden peas: **cross-fertilization/cross-pollination**
- anthers that contain pollen and cross-fertilize using pollen between purple and white (different phenotype) pea flowers
  - cross fertilizing weren't clones!
