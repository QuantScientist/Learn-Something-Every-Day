# Genetics
- mendelian inheritance, how it relates to genotype, phenotype and alleles 
- differences of gene structure between prokaryotes and eukaryotes
- Drosophal

#### Introduction
Mendelian genetics, pedigree analysis is applied for humans
- **phenotype** is something we can see & observe (trait); end result rather than genetic representation
- **genotype**: genetic make up; description of the genetic information (what are the alleles that make it up)
- **progeny**: descendants
- Mendel's experiments with garden peas: **cross-fertilization/cross-pollination**
- anthers that contain pollen and cross-fertilize using pollen between purple and white (different phenotype) pea flowers
  - cross fertilizing weren't clones!
- **monohybrid crosses** come from pure breeds: ex. pure yellow pea and pure green pea
- breeding pures, they're called F<sub>1</sub> progeny, or first filial (monohybrids since only one trait has evolved)
- Discrete units of inheritance are **alleles** of genes, and are instances of a single gene
  - *hair colour* is the gene (object), black and brown are alleles (instances)
- diploid organisms means they only ever have two alleles for a given gene as a part of their DNA (more than one allele may exist among a population though)
- by convention, *genes* are written in italics
- **homozygous** means both alleles are the same for a gene vs. **heterozygous**
- **polymorphic** 
- **gametes** are the reproductive cells
- **Mendel's law of segregation**: two alleles for each trait separate during gamete formation and unite at random during fertilization
- Peas are wrinkled based on whether they are soluble or not
  - starch active branching enzyme makes the starch insoluble, acting catalytically 
- **Dihybrid crosses** with respect to two genes have different alleles for both genes; come from two pure bred homozygous dominant and recessive parents respectively
- **Mendel's Law of Independent assortment**: during gamete formation, different pairs of alleles segregate independently of each other
- by summing genotypic ratios, we get the phenotypic ratios 1:2:1 and 9:3:3:1 for one and two genes respectively
