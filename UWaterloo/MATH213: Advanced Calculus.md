Studying linear, time-invariant dynamic systems using differential equations  
- **differential equations** contain derivatives of some dependent variable with respect to an independent variable
- we can use integration (and techniques like partial fraction decomposition) to simplify and solve for values
- for differential equation: dx/dt = ax(t) - bx(t)^2, when we solve for x(t) we get the **Logistic Equation** (recall that this flattens any real values to a range of (0,1))
  - "peak oil" theory assumes that the cumulative production of resources satisfies the logistic equation (in other words, the first derivative is the logistic curve)
- **boundary value problem** is a differential equation with a sert of additional constraints called boundary conditions
  - 
- linear differential equations contain no constant terms (otherwise called affine)
  - only able to perform analytical solutions when coefficients are constant
  - principle of superposition greatly simplifies analysis
