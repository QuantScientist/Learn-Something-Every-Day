# Combinatorics
Study of finite or countable discrete structures 
- discrete mathematics involves structures and processes that can often be enumerated by integers
- includes counting the structures of a given kind/size
- deciding when certain criteria is met
- four colour theorem: any separation of plane into contiguous regions can bel coloured with no more than four colours so that no two adjacent regions have the same colour
- Fibbonacci from permutations of {S,L}, where S is length 1, L length 2, n = total length
  - compute # of permutations of a set of length n, happens to equal the nth Fibbonacci #
  
A **composition** of a non negative integer `n` is a sequence where m1,..mr are positive integers and n = âˆ‘m1...mr
- Fibbonacci is the number of compositions of an integer, where th elements are 1 or 2
- in example, SSSS -> (1,1,1,1), and SLS -> (1,2,1)
