### Interest Rates

              ↑ F=172,220
1965          |

↓ P=18

F = P(F|P,i,N), F|P mean F given P
F = 18(1+i)^48
solving for i, we get 21% annual ROR over 50 years, or Return on Revenue

**Nominal** is the stated interest rate, agnostic of compounding period (sometimes called APR)
- 12% compounded monthly refers to the nominal rate, but is actually **Effectively** 12.68%
